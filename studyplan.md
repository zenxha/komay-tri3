# AP Test Study Plan

- Work with other scrum members who have the same goal (5 on AP Test)
- Practice College Board sample MCs from Mr. Mort AP Classroom
- Mark/screenshot questions that I had trouble on
- Compile all troublesome questions onto a team google doc
- Work on those questions later with Chris and Caleb

# Teacher tips
- Use Intellij Debugger to review troublesome questions
- Memorize the 4 things they always have to ask in the FRQ section
- Be able to instantly recognize which of the 4 to use
