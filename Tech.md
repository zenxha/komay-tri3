## Linked Lists

- As stated, most "Data Structures" conversations usually begin with Arrays
>- Is built into most Computer Programming Languages
- College Board has Units 6-8 which discuss Arrays, ArrayLists, and 2-Dimensional Arrays
- Most Data Structures conversations continue with the discussions of Linked Lists which are the foundation for Stacks and Queues

## Data Structures

- A data structure is a method of organizing data
- Think of a variable holding a single integer value(ex: int n=4;) or sequences of numbers(ex: int[] numbers=new int[]{ 1,2,3 };) or tables of data, or databases: these are all well-defined data structures.
- Data Structures and organizing data will require students to become more algorithmic in coding.

## Data Structure Algorithms
- There are many algorithms for different purposes and they interact with different data structures.
- Think of algorithms as dynamic underlying pieces that interact with data structures.
- EX:
```
public void swapToLowHighOrder(IntByReference i) {
        if (this.value > i.value) {
            int temp = this.value;
            this.value = i.value;
            i.value = temp;
        }
    }
```
- Together, data structures and algorithms combine and allow programmers to build whatever computer programs theyâ€™d like.
- Good managed data structures and algorithms ensures well-optimized and efficient code.
## Paradigms
#### Imperative Paradigms
- An imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform to achieve a result. Imperative programming focuses on describing "how" a program code works.
#### OO Paradigm
- OOP models complex things as reproducible, simple structures.
- Reusable, OOP classes can be used across programs by simply making an object.
- We have learned about many key aspects of OOP.
- OO based matrix alteration
```
public String reverse() {
        // outer loop starting at end row
        StringBuilder output = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = matrix.length;  0 < i; i--) {
            // inner loop for column
            for (int j =  matrix[i-1].length; 0 < j; j--) {
                output.append((matrix[i-1][j-1]==-1) ? " " : String.format("%x",matrix[i-1][j-1])).append(" ");
            }
            output.append("\n"); // new line
        }
        return output.toString();
    }
```
